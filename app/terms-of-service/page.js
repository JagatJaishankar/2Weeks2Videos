      <p>
        <strong>Effective Date:</strong> 6th March, 2025.
      </p>
      <p>
        Welcome to 2Weeks2Videos! By using my service, you agree to the
        following terms and conditions.
      </p>
      <h3 className="font-bold mt-4">1. Overview of Service</h3>
      <p>
        2Weeks2Videos is an accountability service specifically designed for
        YouTubers. Users begin by accepting a 14-day challenge, entering an
        amount of money (e.g., $5, $10, or $25), and providing their card
        details. If participants successfully upload two videos to their YouTube
        channel within 14 days, their card will not be charged. Otherwise, their
        card will be charged the amount they entered at the start of the
        challenge.
      </p>
      <h3 className="font-bold mt-4">2. User Requirements</h3>
      <p>
        - You must have a YouTube channel to participate, even if it doesn’t yet
        have any videos.
        <br />- All participants must create an account on 2Weeks2Videos.com,
        operated by TheYouTubeCult, to access the tools and resources provided.
      </p>
      <h3 className="font-bold mt-4">3. Payments</h3>
      <p>
        - You are only charged if you fail to complete the challenge.
        <br />- By providing card details, participants authorize TheYouTubeCult
        to process payments on their behalf, as per the agreed terms.
      </p>
      <h3 className="font-bold mt-4">4. Prohibited Activities</h3>
      <p>
        Uploading fake or deceptive videos to complete the challenge is strictly
        prohibited. I expect all participants to approach the challenge
        seriously and with integrity.
      </p>
      <h3 className="font-bold mt-4">5. Limitation of Liability</h3>
