        Welcome to 2Weeks2Videos! By using my service, you agree to the
        following terms and conditions.
      </p>
      <h3 className='font-bold mt-4'>1. Overview of Service</h3>
      <p>
        2Weeks2Videos is an accountability service specifically designed for
        YouTubers. Users begin by accepting a 14-day challenge, and placing $14
        down as a fee. If participants successfully upload two videos to their
        YouTube channel within 14 days, they get 100% of their money back.
        Otherwise, their fee will be kept by 2Weeks2Videos ($14).
      </p>
      <h3 className='font-bold mt-4'>2. User Requirements</h3>
      <p>
        - You must have a YouTube channel to participate, even if it
        doesn&apos;t yet have any videos.
        <br />- All participants must create an account on 2Weeks2Videos.com, to
        access the tools and resources provided.
      </p>
      <h3 className='font-bold mt-4'>3. Payments</h3>
      <p>
        - You will need to pay $14 to start the challenge.
        <br />- By providing card details, participants authorize to process
        payments on their behalf, as per the agreed terms.
      </p>
      <h3 className='font-bold mt-4'>4. Prohibited Activities</h3>
      <p>
        Uploading fake or deceptive videos to complete the challenge is strictly
        prohibited. I expect all participants to approach the challenge
        seriously and with integrity.
      </p>
