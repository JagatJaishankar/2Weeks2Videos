## The Problem

*Most aspiring YouTubers promise themselves they’ll “start posting consistently” and never follow through. They upload once, get low views, lose motivation, and quietly abandon their channel. There’s no real accountability or consequence for missing their own goals, so procrastination always wins.*

## The Solution

*2Weeks2Videos turns content goals into a simple, high‑stakes challenge. Creators put down a $14 deposit, commit to shipping 2 YouTube videos in 14 days, and either deliver on time or lose their money. By adding real consequences and a clear deadline, it removes excuses and makes consistency non‑negotiable.*

## Key Features

- **Challenge On-Boarding** — Set your YouTube goal, pay a $14 deposit, and lock in your 14‑day challenge window.
- **Progress Tracking** — See your active challenge status and deadlines so you always know how many videos are left to ship.
- **Proof of Upload** — Submit video links as proof to mark each video as completed within the challenge period.
- **Payout Logic** — Automatically determine if the creator finished on time and whether their $14 gets refunded or forfeited.
